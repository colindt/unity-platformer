DEMO SCENE:
An example of a mobile/animated sprite with a mobile camera

QUICK START GUIDE:

1. Import "Pixel Perfect" package to your project

2. Replace your game camera with the provided "PixelPerfectCamera" prefab

3. For additional pixel snap, add the "PixelPerfectSprite" behaviour to you sprites (or "PixelPerfectQuad" if you are using quads).

4. Set the "PixelsPerUnit" value to whatever are you using in your sprite import settings.

5. Adjust the camera "zoom" slider in the inspector if you want to scale up your sprites.

6. Adjust the camera "CustomOffset" X and Y values in the inspector to remove small artifacts.

7. Adjust the scale property of the PixelPerfect components at will.

NOTE: if you are using a custom sprite material, be sure to uncheck the "Pixel Snap" option.
